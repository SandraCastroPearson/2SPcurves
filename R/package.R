#' ROC Models for Survival Data from Clinical Trials
#'
#' @description Survival data is often used in clinical trials to determine effectiveness of a new treatment.
#' Analysis of such data is usually completed using two separate Kaplan-Meier curves, a Log Rank Test and Cox Proportional Hazard models.
#' We propose an alternative way to analyze this type of data by combining the two Kaplan-Meier curves into an ROC curve and using the area under the curve (AUC) as measure of treatment effectiveness.
